            <h1>Hi. I'm David</h1>
            <p>Since 2018, I've had passion for programming and during this time,
                I have learnt technologies like Python, C#, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git.
            </p>
    
            <p>I hope to expand my knowledge and grow in the tech industry.
